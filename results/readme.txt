This folder contains the evaluation and predictions of models. It is here so that they can be re-used without having to train the models over and over again just to check its results.

The "fully_trained" folder contains the results of the models which have been fully trained (p-ê inutile vu qu'on peut p-ê pas testé ces modèles).

The "fK_fold" folder contains the results of the models which have been trained using the kfold method.
